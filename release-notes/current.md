# Release Notes (Working Draft)

This file is the working draft for the next release. When a version is tagged, this file is renamed to `<version>.md` and a new empty `current.md` is created.

## Changes

- File tools (`file_create`, `file_str_replace`, `file_insert`, `file_read`,
  `list_directory`, `pdf_read`) and `doc_index` now accept **relative paths**,
  not just absolute ones. Relative paths resolve against the session working
  directory (a shared `resolve_against` helper); the old "path is not absolute"
  rejection is gone. Absolute paths behave exactly as before.
- The `bash` and `powershell` tools now spawn their child process in the session
  working directory. Each call starts fresh from that directory — an in-command
  `cd` no longer leaks into later calls. (Currently the session cwd equals the
  process launch dir; a later change wires the real per-session value.)
